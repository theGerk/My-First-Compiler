While in the home directory execute the file \texttt{compileAndRun.sh} as a shell script. It will produce a \texttt{JAR} file called \texttt{out.jar}. This jar file may be run using \texttt{java -jar out.jar myPascalFile.pas}. Just of course replace \texttt{myPascalFile.pas} with your desired target file.
