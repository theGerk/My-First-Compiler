While in the home directory execute the file \texttt{compileAndRun.sh} as a shell script. It will produce a \texttt{JAR} file called \texttt{out.jar}. This jar file may be run using \texttt{java -jar out.jar myPascalFile.pas}. Just of course replace \texttt{myPascalFile.pas} with your desired target file. It will produce a file \texttt{out.asm}, which can be assmebled to machine language or run in a \texttt{MIPS} interpeter.

If you aren't using a \texttt{UNIX} based system then you should install Ubuntu. Instuctions can be found on Ubuntu's website, you'll need a 2GB or larger flash drive or external disk.

You could also use a virtual machine or just figure out how to compile on Windows but unfortunatnly we don't really support Windows explicitly.\footnote{It is written in Java and thus can be compiled in any Java supporting enviroment.}

Some test programs have been left in \texttt{root/testInput}.
